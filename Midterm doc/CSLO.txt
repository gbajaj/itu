Qs:What is the difference between Static and Dynamic web content? Explain how using a scripting language can create dynamic content on your webpage. If possible, provide an example to support your findings.


Static web content is known as static because its content can not be change dynamically while Dynamic web content can be changed on the fly. Static web content is published in the regular files on your server and has to be republished when it changes and we use HTML and CSS for coding of static pages. On the otherhand Dynamic web content is republished automatically and along with HTML and CSS, client side scripting language such as javascript is required in order to handle the run-time behaviour and unlike Static web content in most of the cases Dynamic web page would need to access database and hence process slowly as compared to static web content.
Also websites with static web content are quick and cheap to develop as contrast to websites with dynamic web content.
Following Problem Statements with definite requirements elaborate the difference of functionality between static web content and dynamic web content:
Problem Statements:
1. I want to advertise about my company and my company products on internet. I am not going to do frequent changes in my content. I donâ€™t want to sell my products online but I would like to have an email feature on my website so that my customer can email me.

2. I want to advertise about my company and its products. My company has a long list of products and it varies from time to time. I would also want the images and graphics of webpages to change frequently so that they can match with new products. I would also want to add the feature of a running clock in my website and a user interaction chat window.
Best solution to the first problem statement would be to use static web content as the length and amount of content is fixed  so the whole requirement would be fullfilled by creating static web content pages and an email link can be posted on static page.
On the other hand best solution for the second problem statement would be to create the dynamic web content pages. As with dynamic content web pages its easy and hassel free to change the content frequently. The feature of running clock can be efficiently added by Javascript. With the help of PHP and Jquery we can create the chat window in our website.
Scripting language such as javascript plays a vital role in maintaining the dynamic nature. Static web content is used for the websites where change required for web content is infrequent, no advanced online ordering facility is required and website is not required to be connected to back-end system. In contrast dynamic web content is used for the websites where change required for web content is frequent, advance online ordering facilty is required and website is required to be connected to back-end system.
