            <p> I am a fun loving person who loves to laugh and make people laugh.
                My name is Jyoti, which means light and I try my level best to give
                justice to my name. I have born and brought up in Northern part of India
                with my three siblings. I was youngest and most pampered child in my family
                and that is the reason I still have some bad habit and for sure now
                my husband is there to take care of those bad habits.
            </p>
            <p> I love exploring new adventures. My yet to be explored adventures are:
                Scuba diving, Sky diving, Surf-boarding,Flying. I know the last adventure
                I mentioned may sound funny but I am really optimistic about it.
