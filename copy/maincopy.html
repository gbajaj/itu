            <h2>Hello, Welcome to my World</h2>
            <p>I am a fun loving person who loves to laugh and make people laugh. My name is Jyoti, which means light and I try
                my level best to give justice to my name.  I have born and brought up in Northern part of India with my three
                siblings. I was youngest and most pampered child in my family and that is the reason I still have some bad habits
                and for sure now my husband is there to take care of those bad habits. </p>


            <p> I love exploring new adventures. My yet to be explored adventures are:
                Scuba diving, Sky diving, Surf-boarding,Flying. I know the last adventure I mentioned may sound funny but I am
                really optimistic about it. </p>

<h2 id="toast"> My Toastmasters Journey</h2>
<blockquote>Words have incredible power.
They can make people hearts soar,
or they can make peoples hearts sore. </blockquote>
<p> Toastmasters is a non-profit International organization. It teaches public speaking skills.<br>
I have joined Toastmasters to come out of my fear of public speaking and I successfully overcome the fear.</p>
<p>Toastmasters was the place with which I fell in love at first sight.<br>
I have participated in speech contest and I won till area level and that was one of the best event of my life.
<em> I would like to continue the journey of Toastmasters for forever...</em></p>
