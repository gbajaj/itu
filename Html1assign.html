<h2> My Toastmasters Journey</h2>
 <blockquote>Words have incredible power.
            They can make people’s hearts soar,
            or they can make people’s hearts sore.

<p> Toastmasters is a non-profit International organization. It teaches public speaking skills.<br>
    I have joined Toastmasters to come out of my fear of public speaking and I succesfully overcome the fear.</p>
<p>Toastmasters was the place with which I fell in love at first sight.<br>
    I have participated in speech contest and I won till area level and that was one of the best event of my life.</p>
<p> I would like to continue the journey of Toastmasters forever and forever...<p>
