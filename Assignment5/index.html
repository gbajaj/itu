		<h2>About My Self</h2>



		<p>I am a fun loving person who loves to laugh and make people laugh. My name is Jyoti, which means light and I try my level best to give justice to my name. I have born and brought up in Northern part of India with my three siblings. I was youngest and most pampered child in my family and that is the reason I still have some bad habit and for sure now my husband is there to take care of those bad habits.</p>
		<p>I love exploring new adventures. My yet to be explored adventures are: Scuba diving, Sky diving, Surf-boarding, Flying. I know the last adventure I mentioned may sound funny but I am really optimistic about it.</p>
