SEN 910 - Instructions for Midterm Exam
Note that I'm giving you a lot of the details here, because I'm not
interested in testing your ability to memorize, instead I want to test
your ability to use HTML and CSS and to apply concepts such as
nesting, elements, attributes, properties and values, and write them
using the proper syntax.
Complete the following exercise in the form of an HTML page
using CSS:

0. Include the following DOCTYPE so that the page
    will validate. Be sure that all of your tags are properly
    nested.
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML
        4.01 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/
    loose.dtd">

a. Be sure that your page has the following elements, all
nested properly, and in the proper order: body, head,
html, style, and title.

• you need to figure out what the proper order and
  nesting is for those five elements


• One of these elements requires the attribute type
with the value text/css so don’t forget to add
that.

a.  Put all the text inside the body element, and in
    appropriate tags to indicate whether it is a regular
    paragraph, or a heading. You’ll need the <p> tag, as
    well as the <h1>, <h2> and <h3> tags.
    b. Use the CSS property text-align with the value
    center to center the top level headline "My Page"

c.  Use two hr elements (with a self-closing tag) to
    separate the three sections of the web page.
    d. Use an <em> tag to markup the text wild so that it is
    emphasized (and by default, appears in italics).
    e. Use an <a> tag to make the word "caffeine" be a link
    to the web address http://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/Caffeine

f.  Use CSS to change the default font for the entire page
    to a sans-serif font. The property you need is font-
    family and the value is sans-serif. Hint: what
    element should you apply the property to so that it
    affects the entire web page?

g. Use CSS to make all the second level headlines red.

h. Use an id attribute on the appropriate HTML element,
    along with CSS to make the words "Green Tea" the
    color green. (Remember that in the style sheet, you put
    a # in front of the name of an id before specifying its
    properties. The property you need is color)
